# Basic Node and Express Project 

This project is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
It started as the boilerplate from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express/), and I customized it while working through the **Basic Node and Express challenges**.
